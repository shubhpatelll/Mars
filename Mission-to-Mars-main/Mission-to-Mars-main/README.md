# Mission-to-Mars
In this work, we use web scraping tools to extract recent news and the descriptions from the "https://redplanetscience.com/" webpage.
Also, we extracted Mars's weather data from the webpage "https://data-class-mars-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars/index.html" and obtained the months of the coldest and the warmest months on Mars. Also, we determined the months of lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars
